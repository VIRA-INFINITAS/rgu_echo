              Throughout life we have different relationships with people. They
              may change from time to time and this is why relationships could
              be a very complex area. Making and maintaining relationships takes
              effort. It means there are things that all parties in the
              particular relationship should do to keep that relationship going.
              Navigating relationships as a student can present many challenges.
              Social relationships can be tricky—a diverse mix of personalities,
              varying expectations, and peer pressure can make it tough to find
              one's place. Additionally, familial relationships might pose
              challenges, especially when balancing independence with family
              expectations and support. Romantic relationships, with their
              emotional complexities and time demands, can add another layer of
              difficulty when you are a student. Balancing these different types
              of relationships while maintaining personal growth and well-being
              can be a significant challenge.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Recognising a Problem</h2>

            <p class="mb-5">
              If you are in a difficult situation and you want to make some
              changes, talk to people you trust, your parents, good friends or a
              counsellor at RGU. Also it is crucial, if you feel unsafe in a
              relationship, ask for help. Be aware that different conflicts are
              an inevitable part of human relationships but you must not
              tolerate any disrespect, abuse or violence in any of your
              relationships. Having positive, healthy relationships is good for
              you. People in supportive, loving relationships are more likely to
              feel healthier, happier and satisfied with their lives and less
              likely to have emotional or physical health problems.
            </p>

              <!-- Left Column -->
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">What you can do</h3>

                <p class="mb-4">
                  All relationships require both parties to work at maintaining
                  them. The best time to learn to create a good relationship is
                  at the start of the relationship. Begin with showing respect
                  the other person's opinion, views, at the same time do not
                  accept any negative gestures towards yourself and invite the
                  other person in to a positive discussion about your different
                  views. This can feel hard for you to do at university as you
                  have left the familiarity of your home relationships, and you
                  do not know other people's reactions and how they see you,
                  which can lead to anxiety. This can make you feel less sure of
                  what you want or how you should act or how you expect others
                  to react. Staying confident in yourself and keeping a positive
                  attitude towards building new friendships can help.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                  If you had good relationships before coming to RGU think about
                  how you were maintaining your good relationship? Was it always
                  your positive contribution to the relationship? How did you
                  encourage other people to contribute to the relationship? If
                  you have certain relationship skills what worked for you
                  before you could use them in the new RGU setting and see if it
                  work again?
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                  Think about: how you make some relationships work and try and
                  apply that to other more difficult relationships. Also think
                  how you would prefer to be treated if you were your friend,
                  parent, flat mate?
                </p>

                <p class="mb-0">
                  Finally, when a relationship is going well, it is important
                  that you still put effort into it and don't take the
                  relationship for granted. Encourage others to do the same, by
                  sharing with them your appreciation for being a good friend or
                  tutor. Think of what you need in a relationship and openly
                  discuss it, where possible and encourage other people to do
                  so. This way, your relationships have the best chance of
                  growing and continuing to be strong and healthy.
