                    <p class="mb-4">Throughout life we have different relationships with people. They may change from time to time and this is why relationships could be a very complex area. Making and maintaining relationships takes effort. It means there are things that all parties in the particular relationship should do to keep that relationship going. Navigating relationships as a student can present many challenges.  Social relationships can be trickyâ€”a diverse mix of personalities, varying expectations, and peer pressure can make it tough to find one's place. Additionally, familial relationships might pose challenges, especially when balancing independence with family expectations and support. Romantic relationships, with their emotional complexities and time demands, can add another layer of difficulty when you are a student. Balancing these different types of relationships while maintaining personal growth and well-being can be a significant challenge.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Recognising a Problem</h2>
                    
                    <p class="mb-5">If you are in a difficult situation and you want to make some changes, talk to people you trust, your parents, good friends or a counsellor at RGU. Also it is crucial, if you feel unsafe in a relationship, ask for help. Be aware that different conflicts are an inevitable part of human relationships but you must not tolerate any disrespect, abuse or violence in any of your relationships. Having positive, healthy relationships is good for you. People in supportive, loving relationships are more likely to feel healthier, happier and satisfied with their lives and less likely to have emotional or physical health problems.</p>
                    
                    <div class="row g-5 mb-5">
                        <!-- Left Column -->
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                            <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">What you can do</h3>
                    
                            <p class="mb-4">All relationships require both parties to work at maintaining them.  The best time to learn to create a good relationship is at the start of the relationship. Begin with showing respect the other person's opinion, views, at the same time do not accept any negative gestures towards yourself and invite the other person in to a positive discussion about your different views. This can feel hard for you to do at university as you have left the familiarity of your home relationships, and you do not know other people's reactions and how they see you, which can lead to anxiety. This can make you feel less sure of what you want or how you should act or how you expect others to react. Staying confident in yourself and keeping a positive attitude towards building new friendships can help.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-4">If you had good relationships before coming to RGU think about how you were maintaining your good relationship? Was it always your positive contribution to the relationship? How did you encourage other people to contribute to the relationship? If you have certain relationship skills what worked for you before you could use them in the new RGU setting and see if it work again?</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-4">Think about: how you make some relationships work and try and apply that to other more difficult relationships. Also think how you would prefer to be treated if you were your friend, parent, flat mate?</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-0">Finally, when a relationship is going well, it is important that you still put effort into it and don't take the relationship for granted. Encourage others to do the same, by sharing with them your appreciation for being a good friend or tutor. Think of what you need in a relationship and openly discuss it, where possible and encourage other people to do so. This way, your relationships have the best chance of growing and continuing to be strong and healthy.</p>
