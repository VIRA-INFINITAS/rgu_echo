                <div class="col-lg-10">
            
                    <p class="mb-4">We all have times when our mood is low, when we feel sad or that we can't be bothered.  During these times, we can all have less interest in things than usual or enjoy things less than we would normally. For most people, these low moods pass on their own or as the situation(s) causing the feelings resolve(s). At other times, there is no obvious trigger or reason for these feelings and they pass either on their own or as the situation(s) causing the feelings resolve(s).</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Sometimes these feelings get so bad that they interfere with a person's daily life, making it difficult to do things like getting out of bed, washing or leaving the house.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Depression is a clinical term for experiencing these sorts of feelings in a pervasive way and over a prolonged period.  Some of the symptoms and the severity of the feelings and their impact on a person's daily functioning can vary.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Impact on studies</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Symptoms of depression include poor concentration, disturbed sleep, feeling very tired and lacking energy, feelings of guilt and low self-worth, lack of hope for the future, feelings of despair, difficulty concentrating or suicidal ideation. These can all interfere with our ability to attend classes, mix with peers, study and submit coursework on time.  It's very easy to fall behind with these things and for hopes and dreams as the situation seems more and more hopeless, or desperate.  If you are noticing that this is happening to you then it's time to take action.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Concern for others</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">If you think that a friend or peer may be struggling with depression you can try to talk with them positively.  Remember that the person may feel guilty or embarrassed about having been struggling and might also feel a sense of hopelessness about ever feeling better. You can encourage the person to speak positively about the situation, but try to stick to listening and helping the person to see that there is hope and that getting support or help is empathic, understanding & important. You can encourage the person to seek help from a health professional.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">If you are concerned that the person is thinking about death or suicide then you should ask them specifically about this if you feel able to.  People often worry that asking about suicidal thoughts will 'put the idea into their head' but however this is not the case.  If a person is not thinking about suicide then asking them about it will not make them start considering this as an option.  If a person IS thinking about death or suicide then talking to them about it can allow the person to share how they feel rather than struggling with this alone and can make you (or others) aware of the need to get professional support for the person, particularly if there is a risk of the person acting on these thoughts and ending their life and can allow the person to share how they feel rather than struggling with this alone.  If a person is thinking about suicide or has a plan for how they might end their life you should encourage them to contact their GP immediately. If you think that they are in immediate danger please contact one of the emergency / crisis lines detailed on the <a href="contacts.html" class="text-decoration-underline">contacts page</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Recognising a problem</h2>
                    
                    <p class="mb-3">Recognising problems with depression involves identifying persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness.  In addition to persistent low mood, there are signs that might indicate an issue with depression:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li class="mb-2">Persistent Sadness or Empty Feeling: Feeling sad, down or having a cheerful most of the day, nearly every day.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Loss of Interest: Losing interest in activities or hobbies that were once enjoyable.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Changes in Appetite or Weight: Significant changes in appetite or weight, either a decrease or increase.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Sleep Disturbances: Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping excessively.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Fatigue or Lack of Energy: Feeling tired or lacking energy most of the time.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Feelings of Worthlessness or Guilt: Having persistent feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or self-blame.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Difficulty Concentrating: Finding it hard to concentrate, make decisions, or remember things.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Recurrent Thoughts of Death or Suicidal Ideation: Thinking about death, dying, or having thoughts about ending one's life.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="mb-5">It's important to note that experiencing one or more of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you're clinically depressed. However, if these symptoms persist over an extended period, typically lasting for more than two weeks, and significantly affect your daily life, you might find it useful to seek professional support. A medical professional or healthcare provider can best make a proper diagnosis and treatment options, which might include therapy, medication, or a combination of interventions such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, practicing mindfulness, and seeking social support can also be beneficial in managing symptoms of depression.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Most people will experience feeling low for a few days from time to time and have recommended some actions that could be useful. But if feelings are not lifting, or they are blocking your ability to do work, socializing to a professional like a GP or private therapist would be useful.</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="mb-2">Try to stick to regular eating and sleeping patterns as much as possible.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">Try to engage in activities routinely (e.g. taking showers, getting dressed, brushing teeth, going outside).</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">Try to engage with activities that you used to enjoy.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">Try to cut down on the use of alcohol and other drug use as these can contribute to depressive symptoms.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">Speak with someone that you trust about how you are feeling.</li>
                                    </ul>
