            <p class="mb-4">
              We all have times when our mood is low, when we feel sad or that
              we can't be bothered. During these times, we can all have less
              interest in things than usual or enjoy things less than we would
              normally. For most people, these low moods pass on their own or as
              the situation(s) causing the feelings resolve(s). At other times,
              there is no obvious trigger or reason for these feelings and they
              pass either on their own or as the situation(s) causing the
              feelings resolve(s).
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Sometimes these feelings get so bad that they interfere with a
              person's daily life, making it difficult to do things like getting
              out of bed, washing or leaving the house.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Depression is a clinical term for experiencing these sorts of
              feelings in a pervasive way and over a prolonged period. Some of
              the symptoms and the severity of the feelings and their impact on
              a person's daily functioning can vary.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Impact on studies</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Symptoms of depression include poor concentration, disturbed
              sleep, feeling very tired and lacking energy, feelings of guilt
              and low self-worth, lack of hope for the future, feelings of
              despair, difficulty concentrating or suicidal ideation. These can
              all interfere with our ability to attend classes, mix with peers,
              study and submit coursework on time. It's very easy to fall behind
              with these things and for hopes and dreams as the situation seems
              more and more hopeless, or desperate. If you are noticing that
              this is happening to you then it's time to take action.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold mb-4">Concern for others</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              If you think that a friend or peer may be struggling with
              depression you can try to talk with them positively. Remember that
              the person may feel guilty or embarrassed about having been
              struggling and might also feel a sense of hopelessness about ever
              feeling better. You can encourage the person to speak positively
              about the situation, but try to stick to listening and helping the
              person to see that there is hope and that getting support or help
              is empathic, understanding & important. You can encourage the
              person to seek help from a health professional.

              <p class="mb-0">
                If you are concerned that the person is thinking about death or
                suicide then you should ask them specifically about this if you
                feel able to. People often worry that asking about suicidal
                thoughts will 'put the idea into their head' but however this is
                not the case. If a person is not thinking about suicide then
                asking them about it will not make them start considering this
                as an option. If a person IS thinking about death or suicide
                then talking to them about it can allow the person to share how
                they feel rather than struggling with this alone and can make
                you (or others) aware of the need to get professional support
                for the person, particularly if there is a risk of the person
                acting on these thoughts and ending their life and can allow the
                person to share how they feel rather than struggling with this
                alone. If a person is thinking about suicide or has a plan for
                how they might end their life you should encourage them to
                contact their GP immediately. If you think that they are in
                immediate danger please contact one of the emergency / crisis

            <p class="mb-3">
              Recognising problems with depression involves identifying
              persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness. In
              addition to persistent low mood, there are signs that might
              indicate an issue with depression:
            </p>

            <ul class="mb-4">
              <li class="mb-2">
                Persistent Sadness or Empty Feeling: Feeling sad, down or having
                a cheerful most of the day, nearly every day.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                Loss of Interest: Losing interest in activities or hobbies that
                were once enjoyable.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                Changes in Appetite or Weight: Significant changes in appetite
                or weight, either a decrease or increase.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                Sleep Disturbances: Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep,
                or sleeping excessively.

              <li class="mb-2">
                Fatigue or Lack of Energy: Feeling tired or lacking energy most
                of the time.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                Feelings of Worthlessness or Guilt: Having persistent feelings

              <li class="mb-2">
                Recurrent Thoughts of Death or Suicidal Ideation: Thinking about
                death, dying, or having thoughts about ending one's life.

            </ul>

            <p class="mb-5">
              It's important to note that experiencing one or more of these
              symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you're clinically depressed.
              However, if these symptoms persist over an extended period,
              typically lasting for more than two weeks, and significantly
              affect your daily life, you might find it useful to seek
              professional support. A medical professional or healthcare
              provider can best make a proper diagnosis and treatment options,
              which might include therapy, medication, or a combination of
              interventions such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy
              diet, practicing mindfulness, and seeking social support can also
              be beneficial in managing symptoms of depression.

                  Most people will experience feeling low for a few days from
                  time to time and have recommended some actions that could be
                  useful. But if feelings are not lifting, or they are blocking
                  your ability to do work, socializing to a professional like a
                  GP or private therapist would be useful.

                    Try to cut down on the use of alcohol and other drug use as
