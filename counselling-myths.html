                            <p class="mb-3">It won't get that bad and think positively of me</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">We are not there to label or judge, or to diagnose. If you are struggling, your feelings are what's valid for you. It's not about how anyone else sees you and you're your family or a friend may be concerned, this is about your wellbeing - something you're entitled to prioritise. Many people referred to the service, even sometimes to the dismay of the person with them when it comes to counselling – counselling staff work closely, work carefully and without preconception – to help you discover what is occurring with you at this time.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">It will be required or demanded for talking about emotions or feelings – I don't think I'm good at this</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">We are aware that you may not have spent much of your life in contexts of therapy, counselling (so not like many TV shows would have you believe) or indeed talking about emotions or feelings, in terms of experiencing then with a professional or by yourself. If that concerns you, be confident that counselling is something we'll help you navigate, providing you the space, time and support to build a comfort. We're not about to throw in together, we will work at the pacing you determine.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">It won't work to take classes away from someone who needs it more</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Even if you think your problems are relatively minor we take you seriously enough to use the service. If they are big enough to prompt you to look into therapy, they can be seen clearly enough to be discussed reasonably.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">My issues aren't related to my studies, why would I ask for help at the university?</h4>
                        <p>You might see your personal life and studies as separate. Sometimes problems in our personal life can impact on our ability to study. It we can help you with those problems and help you to have more awareness of what you are facing, you can use that knowledge for your whole life, including your studies.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">Others will see me going into the counselling service and know that I'm struggling</h4>
                        <p>We want you to feel safe and comfortable when attending and leaving wellbeing and counselling appointments. The waiting area of the service is shared with several other services: Study Skills, Student Help Point, Visa & Immigration service, Student Finance or those that simply want to use the computers.</p>
                        <p>If you are uncomfortable meeting face to face, we offer wellbeing & counselling appointments by Teams, Zoom, telephone, email or chat.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">It's not about my studies, can I still get support?</h4>
                        <p>We support you with anything that is getting in the way of you having a good University experience. If it is important to you, we will take you seriously.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">I'm from a culture where we just don't talk about these things</h4>
                        <p>We are aware that you may not reach out for many reasons, including cultural or society norms and expectations. You may just need a compassionate ear to help navigate decisions you are making or issues you are having. It might be daunting to begin to acknowledge that I am not feeling ok or I can no longer do this the way I have been doing it. We can help you find a way forward in safe confidential space.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">There's a long waiting list</h4>
                        <p>We are pleased that this is no longer the case, over the last two years, our team has tripled in size.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">It's hard to access these services from off campus</h4>
                        <p>We have a range of wellbeing and counselling appointments, daytime and evening by Teams, Zoom, telephone, email or chat, so we can meet you wherever you are in a way that suits you.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">I don't want to commit to 6 sessions</h4>
                        <p>We offer an initial wellbeing appointment, where you can ask further questions and discuss your hopes and concerns about counselling. You can continue to see the Wellbeing Advisor, or if you are happy to do so, be referred to counselling. You can then meet a counsellor (the same one) up to 6 sessions at busy times and 6 sessions at less busy times.</p>
                        <p>You can use us many or as few sessions as you need. You can come for one and see how it goes, and if it not help enough for you, and you get what you need then we're done. You and the counsellor will talk about this as you go along.</p>
