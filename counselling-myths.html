                  We are not there to label or judge, or to diagnose. If you are
                  struggling, your feelings are what's valid for you. It's not
                  about how anyone else sees you and you're your family or a
                  friend may be concerned, this is about your wellbeing -
                  something you're entitled to prioritise. Many people referred
                  to the service, even sometimes to the dismay of the person
                  with them when it comes to counselling – counselling staff
                  work closely, work carefully and without preconception – to
                  help you discover what is occurring with you at this time.

                  We are aware that you may not have spent much of your life in
                  contexts of therapy, counselling (so not like many TV shows
                  would have you believe) or indeed talking about emotions or
                  feelings, in terms of experiencing then with a professional or
                  by yourself. If that concerns you, be confident that
                  counselling is something we'll help you navigate, providing
                  you the space, time and support to build a comfort. We're not
                  about to throw in together, we will work at the pacing you
                  determine.

                  Even if you think your problems are relatively minor we take
                  you seriously enough to use the service. If they are big
                  enough to prompt you to look into therapy, they can be seen
                  clearly enough to be discussed reasonably.

              <p>
                You might see your personal life and studies as separate.
                Sometimes problems in our personal life can impact on our
                ability to study. It we can help you with those problems and
                help you to have more awareness of what you are facing, you can
                use that knowledge for your whole life, including your studies.

              <p>
                We want you to feel safe and comfortable when attending and
                leaving wellbeing and counselling appointments. The waiting area
                of the service is shared with several other services: Study
                Skills, Student Help Point, Visa & Immigration service, Student
                Finance or those that simply want to use the computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are uncomfortable meeting face to face, we offer
                wellbeing & counselling appointments by Teams, Zoom, telephone,
                email or chat.

                We support you with anything that is getting in the way of you

              <p>
                We are aware that you may not reach out for many reasons,
                including cultural or society norms and expectations. You may
                just need a compassionate ear to help navigate decisions you are
                making or issues you are having. It might be daunting to begin
                to acknowledge that I am not feeling ok or I can no longer do
                this the way I have been doing it. We can help you find a way
                forward in safe confidential space.

                We have a range of wellbeing and counselling appointments,

              <p>
                We offer an initial wellbeing appointment, where you can ask
                further questions and discuss your hopes and concerns about
                counselling. You can continue to see the Wellbeing Advisor, or
                if you are happy to do so, be referred to counselling. You can
                then meet a counsellor (the same one) up to 6 sessions at busy
                times and 6 sessions at less busy times.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use us many or as few sessions as you need. You can come
                for one and see how it goes, and if it not help enough for you,
                and you get what you need then we're done. You and the
                counsellor will talk about this as you go along.
